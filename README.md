## 🌐 Background Context

---

## 🔔 Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

---

## 📅 Starting from today

- ✍️ **Write docs & tests first**
  Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything.

- 🚫 **Intranet checks deferred**
  The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, so you can focus on TDD and think about all possible cases.

- 🤝 **Collaborate on tests**
  We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case—but not on the implementation of them!

- 🛡️ **Don’t trust the user**
  Always think about all possible edge cases.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- 🐍 **Why Python programming is awesome**
- 🎮 **What’s an interactive test**
- ✅ **Why tests are important**
- 📝 **How to write Docstrings to create tests**
- 📄 **How to write documentation for each module and function**
- ⚙️ **What are the basic option flags to create tests**
- 🔍 **How to find edge cases**

## 🛠️ Requirements

### 💻 Python Scripts

- 🔧 Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- 🐍 All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- ↩️ All files should end with a new line
- 📄 The first line of all your files should be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- 📄 A ```README.md ``` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- 🎯 Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- ✅ All your files must be executable
- 📏 The length of your files will be tested using ``` wc ```

### 🧪 Python Test Cases

- 🔧 Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- ↩️ All test files should end with a new line
- 📁 All your test files should be inside a folder named tests
- 📄 All test files should be text files (.txt)
- ▶️ All tests should be executed by: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- 📖 All modules should have documentation: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- 📖 All functions should have documentation: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
- 🗒️ Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (length is verified)
- 🤝 We strongly encourage collaboration on test cases to catch every edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
