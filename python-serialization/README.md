## 📝 Description

This project introduces core I/O capabilities in Python:

* Opening and managing files
* Reading from and writing to files
* Working with the `with` statement
* Serializing and deserializing Python objects using JSON
* Handling command-line arguments

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Understand how file handling works in Python
* Differentiate between reading, writing, and appending to a file
* Use `with` statement to safely handle file context
* Explain JSON serialization and deserialization
* Implement custom serialization methods in Python classes
* Access command line parameters in a script

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python version: 3.8.5
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Code style: `pycodestyle` 2.7.\*
* All scripts should be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` is mandatory
* Test cases (where required) reside in the `tests/` directory

## ✅ Tasks

### 0. Read file

Reads a text file (UTF8) and prints its content to stdout.

### 1. Write to a file

Writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.

### 2. Append to a file

Appends a string at the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added.

### 3. To JSON string

Returns the JSON representation of a Python object.

### 4. From JSON string to Object

Converts a JSON string into a Python data structure.

### 5. Save Object to a file

Writes an object to a file using JSON representation.

### 6. Create object from a JSON file

Creates an object from a JSON file.

### 7. Load, add, save

Adds all arguments to a Python list, then saves it as JSON to a file.

### 8. Class to JSON

Returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object.

### 9. Student to JSON

Defines a `Student` class with a method to serialize its attributes.

### 10. Student to JSON with filter

Enhances serialization with an optional filter list of attributes.

### 11. Student to disk and reload

Saves a `Student` to a file and loads it back, updating its attributes.

### 12. Pascal's Triangle

Generates Pascal’s triangle of size `n` as a list of lists.
