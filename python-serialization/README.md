## üìñ Description

This project is dedicated to the study of **marshaling** and **serialization** ‚Äî fundamental concepts in computer science that facilitate the **storage**, **transmission**, and **reconstruction** of data. It focuses on real-world applications and helps build a solid foundation for data handling across various mediums.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

* Understand the difference between marshaling and serialization.
* Serialize and deserialize data in formats such as JSON, Pickle, and XML.
* Work with custom objects and persist their state.
* Convert between CSV and JSON.
* Handle errors and data integrity during the serialization process.
* Recognize where serialization is used (e.g., APIs, distributed systems, file persistence).

## ‚úÖ Tasks

### 0. Basic Serialization

**File:** `task_00_basic_serialization.py`

* Implement:

  * `serialize_and_save_to_file(data, filename)`
  * `load_and_deserialize(filename)`
* Uses `json` to save and reload dictionaries.

‚úîÔ∏è 100% Passed

### 1. Pickling Custom Classes

**File:** `task_01_pickle.py`

* Class: `CustomObject`

  * Attributes: `name`, `age`, `is_student`
  * Methods:

    * `display()` ‚Äî print object's state
    * `serialize(filename)` ‚Äî saves object using `pickle`
    * `deserialize(filename)` ‚Äî loads object using `pickle`

‚úîÔ∏è 100% Passed

### 2. Converting CSV to JSON

**File:** `task_02_csv.py`

* Function: `convert_csv_to_json(csv_filename)`
* Converts `.csv` data into a `.json` file.
* Uses `csv.DictReader` and `json.dump()`
* Handles missing files gracefully.

‚úîÔ∏è 100% Passed

---

### 3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML

**File:** `task_03_xml.py`

* Functions:

  * `serialize_to_xml(dictionary, filename)`
  * `deserialize_from_xml(filename)`
* Uses `xml.etree.ElementTree` to write and parse XML files.

‚úîÔ∏è 100% Passed
