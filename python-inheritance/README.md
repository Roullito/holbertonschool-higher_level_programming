## 📄 Project Description

This project explores **inheritance** in Python, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It covers single and multiple inheritance, method overriding, and usage of built-in functions like `super`, `isinstance`, and `issubclass`.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is a **superclass**, **baseclass**, or **parentclass**
- What is a **subclass**
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- The default class from which every class inherits
- How to override methods and attributes
- Which attributes or methods are inherited
- The purpose of inheritance
- How and when to use:
  - `isinstance`
  - `issubclass`
  - `type`
  - `super`

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All files interpreted with **Python 3.8.5**
- Must be executable
- No import unless explicitly allowed
- Follow **PEP 8** style (`pycodestyle 2.7.*`)
- First line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files must end with a new line

### Python Test Cases

- All test files inside a folder named `tests`
- Test files are `.txt` and must pass with:
  ```bash
  python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
